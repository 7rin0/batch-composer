# comprocess

## Mission
Reduce memory usage of composer require/install/update (without composer.lock file)

### Script
For now this simple Python script installs each required dependency one-by-one ... no improvements where really made due multiple reasons. I will just keep playing arround until find something or some approach more useful and successfull.

### Usage
As i said there's no good reason to use this script but here is a simple explanation:
#### Place comprocess at the same directory of composer.json
``` curl -sSOL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7rin0/comprocess/master/comprocess ```
#### Allow comprocess to execute
``` chmod +x comprocess ```
#### Allow execute
``` chmod +x comprocess ```
#### Run
``` ./comprocess ```
